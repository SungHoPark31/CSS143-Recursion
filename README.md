# CSS143-Recursion
This assignment consists of two parts, both dealing with recursion. 
In the first, you will write a program that recursively searches a 
directory tree. In the second, you will write a program that implements
a binary search of a list of strings. 

Build two classes (LinearSearch ,BinarySearch) that inherit from the 
provided parent class SearchAlgorithm, and a third exception class.
Each of the subclasses will implement only one public method that 
facilitates the appropriate search over an array of Strings.  Also, 
you will need to build one exception class (10 lines of code or less)
that services these two searches in the event the item isnâ€™t found 
in the String array.
